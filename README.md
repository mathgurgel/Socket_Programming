# Socket Programming
Repository of an university project made by _@mathgurgel_ and _@mateus-maximo_.  
The goal was to create a **multiplayer game** in order to learn important concepts in [Computer Networking](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/computer-networking/).

# Jo-Ken-Po!
**Jokenpo** is the Brazilian name for the game **Jankenpon**, in Japan, or, as it is globally known, [**Rock Paper Scissors**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

## Take a look

## Skills learned
- [Socket programming](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)
- [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IPv4)
- [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP)
- [Threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## How to play
- Download the repository and make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
### Same device
- When you are all set, open the `server.py` file once and the `client.py` for each player.
### Multiple devices
- Replace the `SERVER` global variable value with your IPv4 address (e.g., `SERVER = "123.456.789"`);
- Run the `server.py` in a computer and connect both clients to it by executing `client.py`.
### Enjoy!
